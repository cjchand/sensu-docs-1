### Why did you split the repos?

This was done to simplify the deployment and delivery process.  When working with a repo as diverse as the community-plugins it's very hard to version and deploy it in the methods that we all would like.  Splitting the repo into smaller pieces makes this much easier and more manageable in the long run.

### Why are the repos named this way?

The repos are named based up the application, product, or function they are associated with.  This means that if you use apache, you need only install the *sensu-plugins-apache* gem or clone the repo.  When it comes to handlers and mutators the same convention was used so that in the future if a check is added the repo name won't change.  *Sensu-plugins-pagerduty* is a great example, it may only contain handlers at this time but if in the future we want to add a check of an endpoint we don't need to do anything more than bump the version and update the docs.

Besides having a standard naming convention makes automation and deployment tools very happy and we all use them right?

### How do I know what a repo contains?

One of the conditions for dropping the prerelease or alpha tag will be a complete README that will include a list of all binaries and what each one does, [sensu-plugins-disk-checks][1] does this now.

### Why did you change the filenames and why name them this way?

One of the overriding issues is that there should be a standard naming scheme for the entire framework.  It is very hard to effectively automate something if the pieces are scattered or named differently.  As of now the current names are here to stay.

### What about tests, how do I know a plugin works as designed?

Tests are coming, that is one of the core requirements for stability and production grade.  Tests are hard to write for some of these things given the very specific nature of them and most of us have other jobs so we can only contribute so much.

### How do I use this handler, deploy this check?

The readme will contain sample configs and commands.  Many of the plugins also have a header that contains specific details.  If this is lacking ask in [Slack](https://slack.sensu.io) or on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sensu-users) and someone will be able to assist you.

### Will the community-plugins repo be deleted and if so when?

No!  It will be frozen in place at a date TBD, most likely sometime Fall 2015 although that is a moving target and dependent upon a lot of things.

### How should I deploy the new plugins?

If a gem exists then that would be the best way.  Instructions for installing it can be found in the README of the repo or [here][3].  If no gem exists yet, then you can attempt to build one based upon the gemspec.  You can also install straight from source.

All repos have releases, you can just download the latest tarball or zip file, cloning the master branch is not recommended, supported and never will be.  Unless it's a breaking change, the repo will not contain feature branches, everything will be pushed to master.  You have been warned.

### Checks are invasive how do I know they haven't been tampered with?

All gems will be signed and each repo will contain the public key.  If you are really concerned you could just inspect the code yourself as well before deployment.

### Will you be targeting other pkg management systems?

Not at this time, due to the design of Sensu, gems are the best choice.  RPM's and Deb packages have not been ruled out but the manpower to create them is just not there at this time.  If you have a very strong interest in this drop us a line and we can chat some more.

### Are the gems dependent upon Rubygems?

No

### What is the policy on supporting end-of-life(EOL) Ruby versions?

We will target all non EOL Ruby versions, please check the link below the see the current EOL version.

https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/

### What versions or Ruby do you test against?

We strive to test on all non-EOL versions. It can take time to add new versions to all plugins.

### What do you use for linting?

Rubocop

Details are in .rubocop.yml within the root of each repo and in the [developer guidelines][2]

### What do you use for testing?

RSpec

## What is a Sensu plugin?

Sensu plugins provide executable scripts or other programs that can be used as
[Sensu checks][1] (i.e. to monitor server resources, services, and application
health, or collect & analyze metrics), [Sensu handlers][2] (i.e. to send
notifications or perform other actions based on [Sensu events][3]), or [Sensu
mutators][3] (i.e. to modify [event data][4] prior to handling).

### The Sensu Plugin specification

Sensu Plugins provide executable scripts or other programs that can be used  as
a [Sensu check command][5], [pipe handler command][6], or [mutator  command][7].
Sensu plugins must comply with a simple specification:

- Accept input/data via `STDIN` (handler and mutator plugins only)
  - Optionally able to parse a JSON data payload (i.e. [event data][4])
- Output data to `STDOUT` or `STDERR`
- Produce an exit status code to indicate state:
  - `0` indicates `OK`
  - `1` indicates `WARNING`
  - `2` indicates `CRITICAL`
  - exit status codes other than `0`, `1`, or `2` indicate an unknown or custom
    status
- Optionally able to parse command line arguments to modify plugin behavior

_PRO TIP: Those familiar with the [Nagios][14] monitoring system may recognize
this specification, as it is the same one used by Nagios plugins. As a result,
[Nagios plugins can be used with Sensu][15] without any modification._

## Where to find Sensu Plugins

### The Sensu Plugins project

The [Sensu Plugins project][8] is a community-powered [open source software
project][9] that is organized by members of the Sensu community, in
collaboration with the Sensu development team. The Sensu Plugins project
currently maintains _hundreds_ of plugins providing various checks, handlers,
and mutators which are used by thousands of organizations around the world. Most
of the plugins maintained by the Sensu Plugins project are Ruby-based plugins
which are [distributed via Rubygems.org][10] (and [installable via
`sensu-install`][11]).

### Featured Sensu Plugins

To help new users discover some of the most popular plugins for instrumenting
their infrastructure and integrating Sensu with popular tools and services, a
[featured plugins page][12] is provided on the Sensu website. These featured
plugins are the same plugins developed and maintained by the [Sensu plugins
project][13].

### Nagios plugins and the Nagios Exchange

As previously mentioned, the [Sensu Plugin specification][16] is 100% compatible
with the [Nagios plugin specification][17]; as a result, **Nagios plugins may be
used with Sensu without any modification**. Sensu allows you to bring new life
to the 50+ plugins in the official [Nagios Plugins project][18] (which [began
life in 1999][19], making it a very mature source for monitoring plugins), and
over 4000 plugins available in the [Nagios Exchange][20].

### Write your own custom plugins

With a [simple specification][16], which makes it possible to [write Sensu
plugins in almost any programming language][21], it's very easy to write your
own custom plugins for Sensu.

#### Example plugins

The following example demonstrates how to write a very basic Sensu Plugin in the
Ruby programming language.

{{< highlight ruby >}}
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
#
# A simple example handler plugin.

require 'json'

# Read the incoming JSON data from STDIN.
event = JSON.parse(STDIN.read, :symbolize_names => true)

# Create an output object using Ruby string interpolation
output = "The check named #{event[:check][:name]} generated the following output: #{event[:output]}"

# Convert the mutated event data back to JSON and output it to STDOUT.
puts output
{{< /highlight >}}

_NOTE: this example doesn't provide much in terms of functionality (it would
simply be logged to the [Sensu server][23] log file), but it does provide a
starting point for a simple custom plugin._

## Plugin execution

### How and where are plugins executed?

As mentioned elsewhere in the documentation (see: [check commands][5], [pipe
handler commands][6], and [mutator commands][7]), all plugins are executed by a
[Sensu client][24] or [Sensu server][23] as the `sensu` user. Plugins must be
executable files that are discoverable on the Sensu system (i.e. installed in a
system `$PATH` directory), or they must be referenced with an absolute path
(e.g. `/opt/path/to/my/plugin`).

_NOTE: By default, the Sensu installer packages will modify the system `$PATH`
for the Sensu processes to include `/etc/sensu/plugins`. As a result, executable
scripts (e.g. plugins) located in `/etc/sensu/plugins` will be valid commands.
This allows command attributes to use "relative paths" for Sensu plugin
commands;<br><br>e.g.: `"command": "check-http.rb -u https://sensuapp.org"`_

### What programming languages are supported?

Any programming language that can satisfy the [Sensu plugin specification][16]
requirements &ndash; which is nearly any programming language in the world
&ndash; can be used to write Sensu plugins. One of the primary advantages of
writing Sensu plugins in the Ruby programming language is that Sensu itself is
written in Ruby, [and all Sensu installer packages provide an embedded
Ruby][25], eliminating the need to install or depend on a separate runtime.

_NOTE: plugins written in programming languages other than Ruby will require the
corresponding runtime to be installed in order for the plugin to run._

### What is Sensu's `EMBEDDED_RUBY`?

All Sensu Core installer packages provide an embedded Ruby runtime (i.e. even if
a system Ruby is installed, Sensu will run on its own Ruby). This "vendored"
Ruby runtime can be accessed by Ruby-based plugins by setting [Sensu's
`EMBEDDED_RUBY` configuration variable][26] to `true`.

_NOTE: in Sensu versions `>0.21.0`, all init/service scripts provided by the
Sensu Core installer packages are setting Sensu's `EMBEDDED_RUBY` environment
variable to `true`, making the use of Sensu's embedded Ruby the default behavior
in modern Sensu releases._

## Installing Sensu Plugins

### Use `sensu-install` to install Sensu Plugins

The Sensu Core package provides a tool called `sensu-install` (a simple wrapper
around the Ruby `gem` utility). The Sensu Install tool (`sensu-install`)
simplifies installation of Ruby-based plugins. The `sensu-install` tool can be
run with one or more arguments that determine the action(s) to take.

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ sensu-install -h
Usage: sensu-install [options]
    -h, --help                       Display this message
    -v, --verbose                    Enable verbose logging
    -p, --plugin PLUGIN              Install a Sensu PLUGIN
    -P, --plugins PLUGIN[,PLUGIN]    PLUGIN or comma-delimited list of Sensu plugins to install
    -e, --extension EXTENSION        Install a Sensu EXTENSION
    -E, --extensions EXTENSION[,EXT] EXTENSION or comma-delimited list of Sensu extensions to install
    -s, --source SOURCE              Install Sensu plugins and extensions from a custom SOURCE
    -c, --clean                      Clean up (remove) other installed versions of the plugin(s) and/or extension(s)
    -x, --proxy PROXY                Install Sensu plugins and extensions via a PROXY URL
{{< /highlight >}}

_NOTE: `sensu-install` is only available in Sensu Core >= `0.21.0`._

#### EXAMPLE {#sensu-install-example}

The following instructions will install the [Sensu HTTP plugin][22], using the
`sensu-install` utility:

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ sudo sensu-install -p nginx
[SENSU-INSTALL] installing Sensu plugins ...
[SENSU-INSTALL] determining if Sensu plugin gem 'sensu-plugins-nginx' is already installed ...
false
[SENSU-INSTALL] Sensu plugin gems to be installed: ["sensu-plugins-nginx"]
[SENSU-INSTALL] installing Sensu plugin gem 'sensu-plugins-nginx'
Fetching: sensu-plugins-nginx-1.0.0.gem (100%)
You can use the embedded Ruby by setting EMBEDDED_RUBY=true in /etc/default/sensu
Successfully installed sensu-plugins-nginx-1.0.0
1 gem installed
[SENSU-INSTALL] successfully installed Sensu plugins: ["nginx"]
{{< /highlight >}}

To install a specific version of a plugin, simply provide a version number after
the plugin name (separated by a colon); for example:

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ sudo sensu-install -p nginx:0.0.6
[SENSU-INSTALL] installing Sensu plugins ...
[SENSU-INSTALL] determining if Sensu plugin gem 'sensu-plugins-nginx:0.0.6' is already installed ...
false
[SENSU-INSTALL] Sensu plugin gems to be installed: ["sensu-plugins-nginx:0.0.6"]
[SENSU-INSTALL] installing Sensu plugin gem 'sensu-plugins-nginx:0.0.6'
Fetching: mixlib-cli-1.5.0.gem (100%)
Successfully installed mixlib-cli-1.5.0
Fetching: sensu-plugin-1.2.0.gem (100%)
Successfully installed sensu-plugin-1.2.0
Fetching: sensu-plugins-nginx-0.0.6.gem (100%)
You can use the embedded Ruby by setting EMBEDDED_RUBY=true in /etc/default/sensu
Successfully installed sensu-plugins-nginx-0.0.6
3 gems installed
[SENSU-INSTALL] successfully installed Sensu plugins: ["nginx:0.0.6"]
{{< /highlight >}}

_NOTE: as shown in the examples above, the `sensu-install` utility will show the
output of any gems (including gem dependencies) installed using
`sensu-install`._

## The Sensu Plugin gem

### What is the `sensu-plugin` gem?

Although Sensu Plugins [may be written in any programming language][21], there
are certain advantages of writing plugins in Ruby. From an operations
perspective, Ruby-based plugins are convenient because they are able to run on
[Sensu's embedded Ruby][25]. Ruby-based plugins also benefit from the
[`sensu-plugin` gem][27] &mdash; a Ruby library that provides some built-in
functionality and a number of helper classes and that simplify custom plugin
development.

Much of the built-in functionality provided by the `sensu-plugin` gem depends on
custom client, check, and/or handler definition attributes, as documented below.

## Plugin configuration

### Example check plugin definition

The following is an example [Sensu check definition][29] that uses the
`check-http.rb` script provided by the [Sensu HTTP Plugin][22], and a [custom
check definition attribute][28] called `refresh`. Although the `refresh`
attribute itself is not directly supported by Sensu, the `sensu-plugin` gem does
provide built-in support for reducing alert fatigue via the
`Sensu::Plugin::Handler` class (i.e. only handling events on the first
occurrence, and again every N occurrences, where N = `refresh`).

{{< highlight json >}}
{
  "checks": {
    "api_health": {
      "command": "check-http.rb -u https://api.example.com/health",
      "standalone": true,
      "interval": 60,
      "refresh": 60
    }
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

### Sensu plugin definition specification

_NOTE: plugins based on the `sensu-plugin` gem derive configuration from [custom
check definition attributes][28]. The configuration example(s) provided above,
and the "specification" provided here are for clarification and convenience only
(i.e. this "specification" is just an extension of the [check definition
specification][29], and not a definition of a distinct Sensu primitive)._

#### Check definition attributes
